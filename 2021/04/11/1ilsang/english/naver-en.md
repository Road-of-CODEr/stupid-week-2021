- Arman, is everything okay?
- I'm afraid you're not as energetic as you used to be.
- You noticed that, right?
- I feel depressed and overwhelmed these days.
- Can I ask you why?
- My wife has been sick for more than a year.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

- Yoon, I need to leave work early today.
- The doctor referred my wife to a new one at a different hospital, so...
- Okay, don't worry about work.
- See you tomorrow.
- Can you please take care of this report for me?
- No problem. Leave it to me.
- Thanks. I owe you one.

- It's a lot of pressure to go to the United States alone this time.
- Why are you nervous?
- Uh, I used to visit mainly to California, but this time I am going to Mississippi.
- Mississippi? Wow, you mean the place at the southernmost tip of the United States?
- Yes, I have to change planes three times in order to get there.
- There are no direct flights from Korea, so you'll have to transfer from the Chicago airport.
- I heard the Chicago airport is so big that it takes a long time to transfer.
- Well, you've traveled alone a lot, so don't worry.
- Right, this trip seems like an adventure in the unknown world to me.
- Yes, I hope you have a good trip.

- We can go horseback riding, get a suntan, and meet new friends.
- Don't forget golf!
- Golf is my favorite sport.
- Ok, let's do ti.

- Which season do you like the most?
- Well, I have to say either spring or fall.
- Why do you like those seasons?
- It's because warm spring comes after cold winter passes.
- And in fall, leaves changing colors and beautiful.
- Yes, but I think summer is the best of the four seasons.
- I don't like summer, because it's usually hot and humid.
- I know. But I like going to the beach to swim.
