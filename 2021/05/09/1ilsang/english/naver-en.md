- I can't help feeling stressed about our end-of-term exams.
- You really need to loosen up!
- What would you suggest?
- You should take a break from studying sometimes.
- I suppose I should try to get more fresh air.
- You could come hiking with me this weekend.
- That's not my cup of tea.
- You never know until you try.

## 0504

- I've been looking for a job for almost 3 months now.
- Hang in there, Neil. You'll find something.
- At this point, I think I'd just take any job.
- There's an opening at my office, but the pay is low.
- What sort of job is it?
- Just a mailroom clerk. Are you interested?
- You bet! Like I said, I'll do anything.
- Okay, let me talk to my boss about it.

## 0505

- Hey, Greg. Why the long face?
- My boss is giving me a hard time at work.
- Oh, how come?
- He's mad because I requested time off.
- That doesn't sound like a reason to get angry.
- I know, but he blew his top.
- Perhaps you should find a different job.
- I think you might be right.

## 0506

- How about going to the sushi restaurant for lunch?
- That sounds like a plan.
- Great! We can take my car.
- Just give me a few minutes to finish this paperwork.
- Oh, would you like a hand with it?
- No, thanks. It won't take long.
- Okay, just give me a holler when you're ready.
- Sure, will do.

## 0507

- Thanks for helping me paint my apartment, Saul.
- It was my pleasure!
- No, seriously. I owe you one!
- What are friends for?
- Let me at least buy you dinner tonight.
- Sounds like a good deal to me!
- Do you have any place in mind?
- Hmm... I'd love to try the new pizza place.
